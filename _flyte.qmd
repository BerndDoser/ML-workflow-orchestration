# Flyte

[Flyte](https://flyte.org/) is a workflow orchestration platform using Kubernetes and S3 storage.

## Flyte Structure

- **Project**: A collection of workflows, tasks, and executions.
- **Domain**: Deployment level (`development`, `staging`, and `production`)
- **Workflow**: A collection (directed acyclic graph) of tasks.
- **Task**: Fully independent unit of work.
- **Execution**: A run of a workflow.


## Flyte Tasks

- Tasks are strongly typed (See [Flyte Type Mapping](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/user_guide/data_types_and_io/index.html#data-types-and-io))
- Tasks are regular Python function decorated with `@task` 
- Tasks must be idempotent (multiple executions don't change the result).

```python
from typing import List
from flytekit import task

@task
def mean(values: List[float]) -> float:
    return sum(values) / len(values)
```

## Connecting Tasks

Each tasks is encapsulated in a container and the resources are managed by Kubernetes.
