## Why Workflow Orchestration?

::: {.incremental}

- **Reproducibility**: Ensure your experiments are reproducible by tracking the code, data, model, and environment used in each run.
- **Resource management**: Manage resources efficiently by running tasks in parallel and optimizing resource usage.
- **Scalability**: Scale your workflows to handle large datasets and complex pipelines.
- **Monitoring**: Track the progress of workflows and monitor their performance and results.
- **Collaboration**: Enable collaboration between team members by sharing code, data, and results.

## General Requirements for Workflows

  - Parallelization: Run independent tasks automatically in parallel 
  - Caching: Avoid recomputing successful tasks
  - Nesting: Reuse workflows as tasks
  - Looping: Repeat tasks based on conditions
  - Scattering: Distribute data to multiple tasks
  - Conditionals: Branching based on conditions

## Options to Generate a Workflow

- General purpose programming languages (e.g Python)
- Domain specific language (e.g. [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org/))
- Graphical user interface (e.g. [ReactFlow](https://reactflow.dev/) @ [fal.ai](https://fal.ai/dashboard))
