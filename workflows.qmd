## Why do we need a Workflow Orchestration

::: {.incremental}

- **Reproducibility**: Ensure your experiments are reproducible by tracking the code, data, model, and environment used in each run.
- **Resource management**: Manage resources efficiently by running tasks in parallel and optimizing resource usage.
- **Scalability**: Scale your workflows to handle large datasets and complex pipelines.
- **Monitoring**: Track the progress of workflows and monitor their performance and results.
- **Collaboration**: Enable collaboration between team members by sharing code, data, and results.

## Workflow Orchestration

- General purpose programming languages (e.g Python)
- Domain specific language (e.g. [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org/))
- Graphical user interface (e.g. [ReactFlow](https://reactflow.dev/) @ [fal.ai](https://fal.ai/dashboard))
