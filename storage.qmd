## File, Block, and Object Storage

- Differ between storage type and storage access type (file, block, object)
- Throughput vs Latency
  - Traditional: object storage is throughput optimized whereas file/block storage is latency optimized
- Object storage uses RESTful API (cloud-native)
- File uses POSIX, Block uses FC/SCSI

## Block Storage

- Data is divided in uniformly sized blocks
- Blocks ca stored across different storage environments
- Blocks do not contain any information about the content
- local SSD

## File Storage

- Hierarchical structure in files and directories
- NFS
