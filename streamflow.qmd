# StreamFlow
## StreamFlow

- [StreamFlow](https://streamflow.di.unito.it/documentation/0.2/) is a general framework for workflow orchestration
- Relies on the [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org/) (CWL)\
  and connects the CWL with a deployment model
- Workflows can be deployed to different environments:
  - Containers/Singularity
  - Slurm
  - Kubernetes

::: {.callout-note}
[BioExcel Building Blocks](https://bioexcel.eu/biobb-new/) is a **showpiece** using CWL for biomolecular simulation.

## Common Workflow Language (CWL)

::: {layout='[1,1]'}
::: n1
``` {.yaml filename="workflow.cwl"}
{{< include code/workflow.cwl >}}
```
:::
::: n2
``` {.yaml filename="tasl1.cwl"}
{{< include code/task1.cwl >}}
```
``` {.yaml filename="task2.cwl"}
{{< include code/task2.cwl >}}
```

## StreamFlow Deployment

::: {layout='[1,1]'}
::: n1
``` {.yaml filename="streamflow_container.yaml"}
{{< include code/streamflow_container.yaml >}}
```
:::

::: n2
``` {.yaml filename="streamflow_slurm.yaml"}
{{< include code/streamflow_slurm.yaml >}}
```
