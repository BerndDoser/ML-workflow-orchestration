## Summary I

::: {layout='[1,1]'}
::: n1
StreamFlow

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Pros
- Common workflow language (CWL)
- Supports deployment on Slurm and Kubernetes
- No special infrastructure setup needed
:::
::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Cons
- Input and output bindings are redundant and error-prone
- Monitoring and visualization tools are outdated and not user-friendly
:::

::: n2
Flyte

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Pros
- General-purpose workflow orchestrator leveraging Kubernetes
- Robust task interconnections with static typing
- Data pipeline driven by object storage
- Advanced monitoring and visualization features
:::
::: {.callout-important icon=false}
## Cons
- Requires migration of compute nodes from Slurm to Kubernetes
